**ðŸŒˆ Howdy, Iâ€™m Argel-Tal! I'm a final year Data Science student at the University of Otago, originally from Wellington NZ ðŸŒˆ**

My background is a weird mix of Graphic Design, Statistics and Chemistry, though I'm now in the fields of Data Science and Asia-Pacific foreign policy *(with a focus on mainland-China)*.

I'm passionate about using analytical tools to create meaningful insights, and more importantly, about how we communicate those insights to people outside the field of data analytics, and how we discuss vulnerabilities, limitations and biases of our systems.
