**🌈 Howdy, I’m Argel-Tal! A Data Scientist, and grad of the University of Otago, working in Brisbane AU, from Wellington NZ 🌈**

My background is a mix of Graphic Design, Statistics and Chemistry, but I'm now in Data Science and Asia-Pacific security/foreign policy *(with a focus on mainland-China)*.

I'm passionate about using analytical tools to create meaningful insights, and more importantly, about how to communicate those insights for people outside data analytics, and ensuring we discuss vulnerabilities, limitations and biases of our systems.
