**ðŸŒˆ Howdy, Iâ€™m Argel-Tal! A Data Scientist, working in Brisbane AU, from Wellington NZ ðŸŒˆ**

My background is a mix of Graphic Design & Statistics, and I'm working in Data Science, primarily with R & PowerBI. 

I've also got a background in Asia-Pacific security / foreign policy. 

I'm passionate about using analytical tools to create meaningful insights, and more importantly, about how to communicate those insights for people outside data analytics, and ensuring we discuss vulnerabilities, limitations and biases of our systems.
