**🌈 Howdy, I’m Argel-Tal! I'm a final year Data Science student at the University of Otago, originally from Wellington NZ 🌈**

My background is a weird mix of Graphic Design, Statistics and Chemistry, though I'm now in the fields of Data science and Asia-Pacific foriegn policy *(with a focus on mainland-China)*. Currently I'm working on classical and modern AI theory as my main Uni papers.

I'm passionate about using analytical tools to create meaningful insights, and more importantly, about how we communicate those insights to people outside the field of data analystics, and how we discuss vunerabilities, limitations and biases of our systems.
